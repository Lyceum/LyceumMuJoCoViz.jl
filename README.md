This package is a framework for visualizing http://mujoco.org/ dynamics models through the https://github.com/Lyceum/MuJoCo.jl wrapper.

The goal is that trajectories, control policies, and dynamics phenomena can be quickly visuzlied through the use of visualization modes. Some default modes, such as accepting a user supplied control function, are already provided.
